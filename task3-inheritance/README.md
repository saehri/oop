## Getting Started

Welcome to Task 3. In this task we will explore Classes and Inheritance in Java programming language. To get started you can download the code, extract it, and run it on your local machine. PS: Make sure you already installed Java and its latest JDK before you run the program.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
